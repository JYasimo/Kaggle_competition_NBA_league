# Project Overview
This GitHub repository presents an in-depth analysis of a basketball player election dataset using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop an effective predictive model for player selection.
# Encountered Issues
During the analysis, a challenge was identified in the "height" column, where specific entries contained inconsistent values, including dates. Given the potential significance of this feature in basketball player selection, a decision was made to exclude these problematic entries. Subsequent experiments will investigate the validity and relevance of these values.
# Interactive Tableau Visualization
A valuable addition to this repository is the inclusion of an interactive Tableau visualization. For detailed insights, please navigate to the figures file within the models folder and access the dedicated module visualization file.
# Experiment 1: Polynominal Logistic Regression
The initial experiment involved implementing a polynomial logistic regression model, which achieved an impressive Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) score of 0.95891.
the kaggle score was 0.94.
# Experiment 2 : XGBOOST
In this experiment, new EDA was implemented. After implementing the earlier adjustments on EDA, the AUC score of the polynomial regression model on the Test set significantly improved from 0.9888 to 0.99.
Subsequently, upon submitting the XGBOOST results on Kaggle, there was a slight enhancement in the final score from 0.95891 to 0.9612.
# Experiment 3: XGBOOST
XGBOOST has greatly improved with more feature engineering and a final score of 0.99933 was achieved on Kaggle, which represents a significant improvement over the previous XGBOOST model which had a score of 0.9612.
# Future Experiments
Future iterations of the project will incorporate the following strategies:
Utilizing diverse machine learning models.
Exploring advanced feature engineering techniques.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for improved model performance.
# Deployment Considerations
Moving towards deploying a production-ready solution, the following aspects will be prioritized:
Enhancing the user interface for intuitive predictions access.
Proactively addressing ethical biases to ensure fairness.
Establishing real-time monitoring mechanisms to track model adjustments over time.
